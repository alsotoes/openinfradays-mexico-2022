Open source infrastructure is flexible, innovative and interoperable. And itâ€™s made up of many different technologies and providers around the world.Â </p>\n<p><strong>Q: What should my title include? </strong>A: Your title will be used by the attendees to decide among multiple tracks which talk to attend for the next session. It should attract people to your talk. Consider not just the technology as part of the title, but also what you are uniquely bringing to the discussion. A little controversy adds to the attraction. Ending with a question that attendees will want to find the answer to can help.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What should my abstract include? </strong>A: The best abstracts summarize the topic you will present, but also demonstrate that you have the expertise to be \"the one\" to give a talk on this subject matter. State any prerequisite knowledge that might be required, or if it is an entry-level talk (we need those also), say so. Most abstracts are rejected because we cannot determine whether it will be a good talk or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What about my job title? </strong>A: If you have a title with the word \"product\", \"manager\", \"sales\",Â or \"marketing\" in it, you may need to go to extra effort in your abstract to convince us that you will give a good technical talk.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What should I include in learning objectives? </strong>A: Each objectiveÂ should be a concrete insightÂ you expect the audience to gain. This is an additional way to demonstrate your grasp of the subject matter. Do not leave these blank.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I have more time to submit? </strong>A: We start evaluating proposals as soon as they are submitted. The earlier you submit, the less competition we have in front of us for the topic you want to present. Later submissions are compared to your early submission. Taking time to do a good job on the proposal will be reflected in your probability of being accepted. Hacking something together at the last minute just prior to the deadline is not a strategy for success.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Contact Information</strong><br>For additional questions, please contact <a href=\"mailto:speakers@openinfradays.mx\">speakers@openinfradays.mx</a></p>",
